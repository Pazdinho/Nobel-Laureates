# Nobel-Laureates

This is the *Nobel Laureates Analysis* project I made myself.


<p>Medical researchers have found that if the medicine label contains only text, a person learns only 70% of the information on it. But if a piece of instructions has pictures, a person will learn 95%. In this project, you will explore data about Nobel laureates and apply Python tools for visualization. Start with data cleaning that includes handling missing values and dealing with duplicates. Then proceed to the data visualization. By the end of the project, you will get the graphs showing the main insights for the dataset</p><br/><br/>
